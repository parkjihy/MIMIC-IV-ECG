# MIMIC-IV-ECG

In this project, we tackle the binary classification of ECG signals using the MIMIC-IV-ECG dataset. The classification goal is to detect two types of arrhythmias: atrial fibrillation (AFib) and atrial flutter (AFlutter). ECGs that exhibit either arrhythmia are labeled as positive; otherwise, they are negative. The dataset includes 10-second Lead-II ECG waveforms and corresponding diagnostic machine reports. We explored and compared several neural network architectures to identify the most suitable model for this task.â€¨
